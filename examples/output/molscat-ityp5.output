          N.B. THESE MOMENTS MUST CORRESPOND RESPECTIVELY TO X, Y, Z COORDINATES USED TO DEFINE INTERACTION POTENTIAL

  QUANTUM NUMBERS FOR INTERACTING PAIR:
  EACH PAIR STATE IS LABELLED BY  3 QUANTUM LABELS
  EACH CHANNEL FUNCTION IS FORMED BY COMBINING A PAIR STATE WITH A VALUE OF L.
  THE RESULTING BASIS SET IS ASYMPTOTICALLY DIAGONAL.
